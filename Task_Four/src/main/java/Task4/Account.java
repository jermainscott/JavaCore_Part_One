package Task4;
/*  Task 4 - Account Service (Interfaces)
Imagine an interface AccountService that is designed for keeping track of accounts and balances.
It has two abstract methods:

findAccountByOwnerId(long id) takes user id and returns this user account or null in case no account was found;
countAccountsWithBalanceGreaterThan(long balance)
returns the number of accounts with a balance exceeding the provided number.

There are also two classes: Account and User, each of them having several fields.
The owner field of the Account class is an object of the User type. You can find the details in the provided template.


Your task is to create an AccountServiceImpl class that implements the AccountService interface
and its two methods. It should have a constructor that takes an Account array which will be used
for searching when either of the methods is called.For example, to find an account by the user id
we need to go through all the accounts from this array and compare these accounts owners id with the given id.

interface AccountService {
    /**
     * It finds an account by owner id
     * @param id owner unique identifier
     * @return account or null
     */
    Account findAccountByOwnerId(long id);
    /**
     * It count the number of account with balance > the given value
     * @param value
     * @return the number of accounts
     */
    long countAccountsWithBalanceGreaterThan(long value);
}

// Declare and implement your AccountServiceImpl here

class AccountServiceImpl implements AccountService {

    private Account[] accounts;

    //Constructor
    public AccountServiceImpl(Account[] accounts){
        this.accounts = accounts;

        return null;
    }

        long counter = 0;

                counter ++;

service.findAccountByOwnerId(10L); // returns an account where owner id is 10

    Note: do not make classes and the interface public.*/
